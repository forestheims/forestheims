I am a thoughtful software engineer confident and competent in planning, building and deploying full stack applications using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node). I am versed in and enjoy the creativity and psychology aspects of UX/UI Design, as well as systematic Test Driven Development writing, updating and debugging RESTful API's.

Lately I've been finding inspiration by getting into game development, learning Unity, C#, and Blender.

I come from an academic background of chemistry, philosophy, and art. Education will always be a value I hold, and I enjoy teaching and continuously learning.

I am particularly interested in bioinformatics, psychology, 3D engineering, audio engineering, audio visualization, game development, Linux, cybersecurity, computational chemistry/biology, genetic algorithms, drug discovery, organic chemistry, psychopharmacology, psychonautics, and open source software and education.

Tech Stack:

- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, C# 
- Libraries: React.js, Node.js, Jest
- Frameworks: Express.js, vanilla JavaScript
- Tools: Git, Visual Studio Code, Slack, Discord
- SasS: Netlify, Heroku, Supabase
- Other Libraries: fetch, superagent, three.js, tone.js
- Game Development: Unity, Blender
