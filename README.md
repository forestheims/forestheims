# Currently looking for work.

Hello, my name is Forest.

I am particularly interested in bioinformatics, psychology, 3D engineering, audio engineering, game development, linux, cybersecurity, computational chemistry/biology, genetic algorithms, drug discovery, pschopharmacology, psychonautics, and open source software and education.
