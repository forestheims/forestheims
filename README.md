ðŸ§  Molecular modeling researcher by day, curious code alchemist by night. I'm currently pursuing a PhD focused on computational drug design for serotonin receptors, with a particular interest in neuroplastogens and other therapeutics inspired by psychedelics and natural products. My research explores the interface of molecular docking, machine learning, and receptor dynamics to better understand â€” and potentially transform â€” mental health treatment.

ðŸ’» Outside the lab, Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer passionate about creating intuitive, visual tools that bridge science and technology. I believe in the power of accessible, open science, and love designing things that help researchers (and the curious) see molecules in a new light.

ðŸŒ¿ Whether Iâ€™m modeling receptor-ligand interactions or foraging ideas from natureâ€™s molecular library, Iâ€™m driven by a deep sense of wonder and a desire to make thoughtful, lasting impact.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re into computational chemistry, mindful tech, or the wild frontier of drug discovery.
